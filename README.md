## Introduction

Tokenization is a crucial step in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning. The B2T Tokenizer breaks down text into smaller units called tokens. These tokens can be words, phrases, or even characters, depending on your requirements. By using this tokenizer, you can prepare your data for models that rely on tokenized input, such as large language models (LLMs).

The B2T Tokenizer is designed to be simple yet powerful. It aims to streamline the process of converting raw text into a format suitable for AI systems.

## Features

- **Efficient Tokenization**: Quickly converts text into tokens with minimal overhead.
- **Customizable**: Adjust settings to fit your specific data needs.
- **Supports Multiple Languages**: Works with various languages, making it versatile for global applications.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that can be integrated into existing machine learning workflows.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and examples to help you get started.

## Usage

Hereâ€™s a quick example of how to use the B2T Tokenizer in your project:

```python
from b2t_tokenizer import Tokenizer

# Initialize the tokenizer
tokenizer = Tokenizer()

# Tokenize a sample text
text = "Hello, world! Welcome to B2T Tokenizer."
tokens = tokenizer.tokenize(text)

print(tokens)
```

### Advanced Usage

You can customize the tokenizer by adjusting its parameters. For example, you can change the tokenization method or specify a different language. Check the documentation for more options.
